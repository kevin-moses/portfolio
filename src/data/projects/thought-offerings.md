## Overview

"Thought Offerings" is an interactive 3D web experience where users can anonymously release their thoughts. As users type, their words become particles that cascade down to feed a dynamic, digital flame modeled after a Hindu havan. The more thoughts offered, the more intense the fire becomes. It serves as a solitary, ritualistic digital space for ephemeral expression, challenging the internet's culture of permanence. This 2-week project has been used by over two dozen people.

## Motivation

As a Guyanese American raised Hindu, I wanted to blend two powerful memories: the ephemeral, cathartic experience of a childhood website called "The Thoughts Room" (where words faded into stars) and the Hindu ritual of havan (feeding a sacred fire with prayers). I was interested in creating a small, positive space on the internet—a place where thoughts could be discarded outside of the user’s head without being saved, judged, or recorded.

## Experience, Learning, and Skills

This 2-week sprint at the Nø School Nevers art-tech summer school was a rapid prototyping challenge. I learned to translate an abstract spiritual concept into a tangible, interactive experience. The main challenge was balancing user trust (ensuring anonymity) while creating an engaging, ritualistic feel. Key skills practiced include creative coding, 3D web development, and creating dynamic particle systems. The experience was built entirely in three.js. The core components are a dynamic fire animation (simulating a havan) and a particle system that converts user text input into "offerings." The intensity of the fire is directly linked to the volume of user contributions.

## Reflection

User feedback confirmed the "solitary" and "ritualistic" feel I aimed for, with some calling it "countercultural" for its rejection of permanence. I was surprised by how deeply ingrained the fear of being recorded is, as some users were still nervous about privacy, even though I stated it was anonymous. This project reinforced my interest in creating intimate digital experiences that prioritize feeling and release over data collection.
